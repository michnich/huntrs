                All sales are binding. The seller is responsible for accurately listing their items, and the buyer is responsible for reading the item description before
                making a purchase. The seller is obligated to ship the order to complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional
                circumstance. The buyer is obligated to deliver the appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance. Our Cancellation

            <p dir="ltr">
                The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may not alter the item’s price after a sale for
                the purpose of avoiding HUNTRS transaction fees, misrepresent the item’s location, or use another user’s account without permission.

            <p dir="ltr">
                Offers to buy or sell outside of the Website are a potential fraud risk for both buyers and sellers and are not protected by the HUNTRS Trust Promise, the
                Agreement, or other buyer/seller protection programs. Additionally, these offers may be an attempt to avoid HUNTRS transaction fees. This is unfair to
                other sellers and violates the Agreement, and will result in account termination. You may not exchange personal information or engage in any other
                activities to transact with another in any manner to avoid any transaction fee or the HUNTRS Secure Checkout process. You may not manipulate the price of
                any item or fees owed to HUNTRS when using the Website or Services.

                When you sell an item on HUNTRS (except for certain categories such as wedding items or any items valued at $2,500 or more), the seller has the option to
                receive a HUNTRS shipping kit with prepaid postage and pre-addressed to the buyer in order to mail the item sold to the buyer. Seller also has the option
                to handle shipping on her own by adding reasonable shipping and handling fees to the sale price in order to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the
                item sold to the buyer. HUNTRS requires “Delivery with Signature Required” for any packages of items valued at $500 or more.

                In order to get paid for completed sales, sellers may be required to complete our Verified Seller Program in order to verify your identity and for HUNTRS
                to maintain a safe place to buy and sell. At any time, HUNTRS may require a seller to re-verify his or her identify. As part of our Verified Sellers
                Program, and as enforced by regulatory requirements relating to online payments, you will be required to provide your Social Security Number (SSN) or
                Employer Identification Number (EIN). This information is used for verification purposes only and will not be stored by HUNTRS.

                HUNTRS, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on any earnings based on certain factors, including but not limited to, the sale of an expensive item,
                designer brand item, or wedding dress, for up to four days after the delivery date to ensure the buyer’s satisfaction and to protect the buyer from replica
                sales or other misrepresentations by the seller (including but not limited to condition, color, size, and style as displayed in the item description and
                photos on the listing on our Website). The seller’s funds will automatically be released after the holding period if HUNTRS is not alerted to any issues
                with the purchased item.

                HUNTRS's Resale of Returned Items
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                When you return an item purchased on the Website or using our Services, HUNTRS may relist and resell it on one of HUNTRS’s in-house accounts, including
                Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, Abbey R and Lady Madonna. The items resold will only be authentic items which have passed authentication by HUNTRS and/or
                HUNTRS’s third party authentication partners. In exchange for the right to resell, for HUNTRS’ own account, items that the seller sells and the buyer
                returns to HUNTRS, the seller will retain her/his earnings from the sale and the buyer will receive site credit for the item returned to HUNTRS. During
                special promotions, some items from HUNTRS' in-house accounts may be marked Final Sale or Non-returnable.

                Verified Rights Owners Program (VRO): To enforce the intellectual property rights of owners, HUNTRS engages in a Verified Rights Owners program that allows
                owners to request HUNTRS to remove certain listings that offer items or contain images or other materials that infringe on their intellectual property
                rights. These rights can include trademark, copyright, and/or other legal rights. For example, a Verified Rights Owner may ask HUNTRS to remove an item
                being sold that uses the rights owner's registered trademark (such as a logo on a designer handbag) if the item is not an authentic product of the rights
                owner. This VRO program helps protect HUNTRS members from buying or selling items that may be replica or otherwise unauthorized under state and/or federal
                laws. Before a listing is removed, a Verified Rights Owner must provide to HUNTRS information that ensures that the person or company reporting the item is
                authorized to do so. If a Verified Rights Owner believes a listing violates their intellectual property rights, please provide HUNTRS with a written notice

            <p dir="ltr">
                All sales are binding. The seller is responsible for accurately listing their items, and the buyer is responsible for reading the item description before
                making a purchase. The seller is obligated to ship the order to complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional
                circumstance. The buyer is obligated to deliver the appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance. Our Cancellation
            Policy is available via the following link:    <a href="http://help.tradesy.com/article/63-cancellation-policy/?tref=terms">http://help.HUNTRS.co/article/63-cancellation-policy</a>.

            <p dir="ltr">
                The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may not alter the item’s price after a sale for
                the purpose of avoiding HUNTRS transaction fees, misrepresent the item’s location, or use another user’s account without permission.

            <p dir="ltr">
                Offers to buy or sell outside of the Website are a potential fraud risk for both buyers and sellers and are not protected by the HUNTRS Trust Promise, the
                Agreement, or other buyer/seller protection programs. Additionally, these offers may be an attempt to avoid HUNTRS transaction fees. This is unfair to
                other sellers and violates the Agreement, and will result in account termination. You may not exchange personal information or engage in any other
                activities to transact with another in any manner to avoid any transaction fee or the HUNTRS Secure Checkout process. You may not manipulate the price of
                any item or fees owed to HUNTRS when using the Website or Services.

                When you sell an item on HUNTRS (except for certain categories such as jewlery valued at $2,500 or more), the seller has the option to receive a HUNTRS
                shipping kit with prepaid postage and pre-addressed to the buyer in order to mail the item sold to the buyer. Seller also has the option to handle shipping
                on her own by adding reasonable shipping and handling fees to the sale price in order to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the item sold to the
                buyer. HUNTRS requires “Delivery with Signature Required” for any packages of items valued at $500 or more.

                photos on the listing on our Website). The seller’s funds will automatically be released after the holding period if HUNTRS is not alerted to any issues

                When you return an item purchased on the Website or using our Services, HUNTRS may relist and resell it on one of HUNTRS’s in-house accounts, including

                returns to HUNTRS, the seller will retain her/his earnings from the sale and the buyer will receive site credit for the item returned to HUNTRS. During
                special promotions, some items from HUNTRS' in-house accounts may be marked Final Sale or Non-returnable.

                Verified Rights Owners Program (VRO): To enforce the intellectual property rights of owners, HUNTRS engages in a Verified Rights Owners program that allows
                owners to request HUNTRS to remove certain listings that offer items or contain images or other materials that infringe on their intellectual property
                rights. These rights can include trademark, copyright, and/or other legal rights. For example, a Verified Rights Owner may ask HUNTRS to remove an item
                being sold that uses the rights owner's registered trademark (such as a logo on a designer handbag) if the item is not an authentic product of the rights
                owner. This VRO program helps protect HUNTRS members from buying or selling items that may be replica or otherwise unauthorized under state and/or federal
                laws. Before a listing is removed, a Verified Rights Owner must provide to HUNTRS information that ensures that the person or company reporting the item is
                authorized to do so. If a Verified Rights Owner believes a listing violates their intellectual property rights, please provide HUNTRS with a written notice
